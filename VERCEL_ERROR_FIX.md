# ðŸ”§ Vercel Deployment Error - Troubleshooting Guide

**Error**: "Application error: a client-side exception has occurred"

---

## Quick Fix Steps

### Step 1: Check Vercel Deployment Logs

1. Go to: https://vercel.com/dashboard
2. Select your project: `bug-bounty-mini-app`
3. Click on the failed deployment
4. Check "Build Logs" and "Function Logs"
5. Look for specific error messages

### Step 2: Common Causes & Fixes

#### Issue 1: React Hydration Mismatch
**Symptoms**: Client-side exception, works locally but fails on Vercel

**Fix**: Add this to your page components
```typescript
// In app/page.tsx or components that use dynamic data
"use client"

import dynamic from 'next/dynamic'

// Disable SSR for components that cause hydration issues
const BountyBoardMagic = dynamic(
  () => import('@/components/bounty-board-magic').then(mod => ({ default: mod.BountyBoardMagic })),
  { ssr: false }
)
```

#### Issue 2: Environment Variables Missing
**Check if these are set in Vercel**:
```bash
NEXT_PUBLIC_WALLETCONNECT_PROJECT_ID
NEXT_PUBLIC_ALCHEMY_ID
NEXT_PUBLIC_CONTRACT_ADDRESS
```

Go to: Vercel Dashboard â†’ Project â†’ Settings â†’ Environment Variables

#### Issue 3: React 19 + Next.js 15 Compatibility
**Error**: Incompatibility between React 19 and some packages

**Fix**: Check package versions
```bash
npm list react react-dom
# Should both be 19.0.0
```

## Immediate Fix to Deploy

Let me create a safer version of the page that won't crash:

### Option A: Disable SSR for BountyBoardMagic

**File**: `app/page.tsx`

Replace with:
```typescript
"use client"

import dynamic from "next/dynamic"
import { Header } from "@/components/header"

// Load BountyBoardMagic only on client side
const BountyBoardMagic = dynamic(
  () => import("@/components/bounty-board-magic").then(mod => ({ default: mod.BountyBoardMagic })),
  { 
    ssr: false,
    loading: () => <div className="flex items-center justify-center min-h-screen">Loading...</div>
  }
)

export default function Home() {
  return (
    <div className="min-h-screen bg-background">
      <Header />
      <main className="container mx-auto px-4 py-8">
        <BountyBoardMagic />
      </main>
    </div>
  )
}
```

### Option B: Simplify to Basic Version

Create a simpler fallback page that definitely works:

```typescript
import { BountyBoard } from "@/components/bounty-board"
import { Header } from "@/components/header"

export default function Home() {
  return (
    <div className="min-h-screen bg-background">
      <Header />
      <main className="container mx-auto px-4 py-8">
        <BountyBoard /> {/* Use simpler version */}
      </main>
    </div>
  )
}
```

## Diagnostic Steps

### Check 1: View Build Output
```bash
# Locally test the production build
npm run build
npm run start

# If this works but Vercel doesn't, it's an environment issue
```

### Check 2: Check Browser Console
Open Vercel deployed site and check browser console:
- F12 â†’ Console tab
- Look for specific React error messages
- Note the component name causing the error

### Check 3: Check if it's a Specific Route
- Does `/` (home) fail but other routes work?
- Try: `/dashboard` or `/bounty/1`
- If only home fails, it's the BountyBoardMagic component

## Most Likely Fix

Based on the error and our recent changes, the issue is probably:

1. **React 19 SSR issue** with complex components
2. **Hydration mismatch** between server and client
3. **Frame SDK** trying to run on server

**Quick Fix**: Disable SSR for the main component

## Apply the Fix Now

Run these commands:
```bash
cd C:\Users\olo\Programmes\Bug_bounty_mini_app_base\farcaster-bug-bounty

# I'll create a fixed version of page.tsx
```

Would you like me to:
1. âœ… Apply the SSR disable fix (recommended)
2. Check Vercel deployment logs (need access)
3. Create a simpler fallback version

Let me know and I'll fix it immediately!
