# üéØ Complete Setup Guide - From Zero to Running App

This guide walks you through everything needed to get the bug bounty app fully working.

## What You'll Have at the End

‚úÖ Smart contract deployed on Base mainnet  
‚úÖ App running locally  
‚úÖ Can create bounties with your wallet  
‚úÖ Bounties stored on-chain  
‚úÖ Ready to deploy to production  

## Timeline

- **5 min** - Prerequisites
- **10 min** - Deploy contract
- **5 min** - Configure app
- **2 min** - Run app
- **Total: ~22 minutes**

---

## Phase 1: Prerequisites (5 min)

### 1.1 Install Node.js

Download & install from https://nodejs.org (LTS version 18+)

Verify:
```bash
node --version  # Should show v18+
npm --version   # Should show 9+
```

### 1.2 Install Foundry (for contract deployment)

**Windows (PowerShell as Admin):**
```powershell
irm https://foundry.paradigm.xyz | iex
```

**macOS/Linux:**
```bash
curl -L https://foundry.paradigm.xyz | bash
foundryup
```

Verify:
```bash
forge --version  # Should show latest version
```

### 1.3 Get Wallet & ETH

**Create new wallet:**
```bash
cast wallet new
# Saves: Private Key, Address, Mnemonic
```

Or use existing wallet - get private key from MetaMask:
- Settings ‚Üí Account Details ‚Üí Export Private Key

**Get Base ETH:**
- Buy from exchange (Coinbase, Kraken, etc.) - cheapest option
- Bridge from Ethereum: https://bridge.base.org
- Need at least **0.05 ETH** for deployment + testing

### 1.4 Get Basescan API Key (optional but recommended)

1. Go to https://basescan.org/apis
2. Sign up / login
3. Create API key
4. Copy the key

---

## Phase 2: Deploy Smart Contract (10 min)

### 2.1 Prepare Environment File

In `contracts/.env`:

```bash
# Your private key without 0x prefix
PRIVATE_KEY=abc123def456xyz789...

# Your wallet address (receives fees)
FEE_COLLECTOR=0x1234567890123456789012345678901234567890

# Basescan for verification
BASESCAN_API_KEY=your_api_key_here

# RPC URLs (don't change these)
BASE_MAINNET_RPC_URL=https://mainnet.base.org
BASE_SEPOLIA_RPC_URL=https://sepolia.base.org
```

**‚ö†Ô∏è Security:**
- Never commit this file!
- Already in .gitignore ‚úì
- Don't share private key!

### 2.2 Verify Contract Compiles

```bash
cd contracts
forge build
```

Expected output:
```
Compiling 8 files with Solc 0.8.20
Solc 0.8.20 finished in 4.23s
Compiler run successful!
```

### 2.3 Deploy to Base Mainnet

```bash
forge script script/DeployBountyManagerV2.s.sol --rpc-url base --broadcast --verify
```

**What to expect:**
- Takes 30-60 seconds
- Shows gas estimate
- Asks for confirmation
- Deploys contract
- Auto-verifies on BaseScan

**Output will show:**
```
BountyManagerV2 deployed to: 0x1234567890123456789012345678901234567890
Fee Collector: 0xabcdefabcdefabcdefabcdefabcdefabcdefabcd
```

### 2.4 Copy Contract Address

Save the deployed address:
```
0x1234567890123456789012345678901234567890
```

You'll need this in the next step.

### 2.5 Verify on BaseScan

Visit:
```
https://basescan.org/address/0x1234567890123456789012345678901234567890
```

Should show:
- ‚úÖ Contract code
- ‚úÖ Transactions
- ‚úÖ "Contract Source Code Verified" badge

---

## Phase 3: Configure App (5 min)

### 3.1 Create `.env.local` File

In root directory (not in contracts/):

```env
# Contract address from deployment (from step 2.4)
NEXT_PUBLIC_BOUNTY_MANAGER_ADDRESS=0x1234567890123456789012345678901234567890

# Base mainnet RPC
NEXT_PUBLIC_BASE_RPC_URL=https://mainnet.base.org

# App URL (for Farcaster)
NEXT_PUBLIC_URL=http://localhost:3000
```

### 3.2 Install Dependencies

```bash
cd ..  # Go back to root
pnpm install
```

Or if you don't have pnpm:
```bash
npm install
```

Wait for installation (~1-2 minutes).

---

## Phase 4: Run App (2 min)

### 4.1 Start Development Server

```bash
pnpm dev
```

You should see:
```
  ‚ñ≤ Next.js 15.2.4
  - Local:        http://localhost:3000
  - Environments: .env.local
```

### 4.2 Open in Browser

Go to: http://localhost:3000

You should see:
- üé® Bounty board UI
- üí∞ Empty bounty list
- ‚ûï Create Bounty button
- üë§ Connect Wallet button

## Troubleshooting

### "Cannot find Forge"
```bash
# Add to PATH
export PATH="$HOME/.foundry/bin:$PATH"
# Or reinstall
foundryup
```

### "Private key invalid"
- Remove `0x` prefix
- Check it's 64 hex characters
- No spaces or extra characters

### "Insufficient balance"
- Need more ETH on Base
- Check with: `cast balance 0xyouraddress --rpc-url base`
- Bridge more ETH: https://bridge.base.org

### "Contract not found"
- Verify address is correct
- Check BaseScan: https://basescan.org/address/0x...
- Might be wrong network

### App shows "Error connecting to contract"
- Check contract address in `.env.local`
- Ensure RPC URL is working
- Clear browser cache (Ctrl+Shift+Delete)
- Restart dev server

### "Wrong network" from MetaMask
- MetaMask should auto-switch to Base
- Manual: Add Base network to MetaMask
- Go to https://chainlist.org
- Search "Base"
- Click "Connect Wallet"
- Approve

## Next Steps

### 1. Deploy to Production

```bash
# Make sure everything works locally first
git push origin main
# Vercel auto-deploys

- Go to https://vercel.com/dashboard
- Select project
- Settings ‚Üí Environment Variables
- Add `NEXT_PUBLIC_BOUNTY_MANAGER_ADDRESS`
- Add `NEXT_PUBLIC_BASE_RPC_URL`

### 2. Share with Community
