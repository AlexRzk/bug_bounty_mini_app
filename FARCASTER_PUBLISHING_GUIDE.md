## Step 1: Verify Your Frame Configuration

Your frame is already configured! Let's check the settings:

### Check `farcaster.json`
```bash
cat farcaster.json
```

Should show:
```json
{
  "name": "Bug Bounty Platform",
  "version": "0.0.1",
  "splashImageUrl": "https://bug-bounty-mini-app-swib.vercel.app/splash.png",
  "homeUrl": "https://bug-bounty-mini-app-swib.vercel.app",
  "webhookUrl": "https://bug-bounty-mini-app-swib.vercel.app/api/webhook"
}
```

### Check Frame Metadata
Your `app/layout.tsx` should have Open Graph tags for Farcaster frames.

---

## Step 2: Test Your Frame Locally

### Option 1: Farcaster Frame Validator
1. Go to: https://warpcast.com/~/developers/frames
2. Enter your URL: `https://bug-bounty-mini-app-swib.vercel.app`
3. Click "Validate Frame"
4. Check that metadata loads correctly

### Option 2: Use Frame Simulator
```bash
# Install frame simulator (if needed)
npm install -g @farcaster/frame-simulator

# Test your frame
frame-simulator https://bug-bounty-mini-app-swib.vercel.app
```

---

## Step 3: Create a Farcaster Cast with Your Frame

### Method 1: Using Warpcast (Easiest)

1. **Open Warpcast** (app or web: https://warpcast.com)

2. **Create a new cast**

3. **Add your frame URL**:
   - Paste: `https://bug-bounty-mini-app-swib.vercel.app`
   - Warpcast will automatically detect the frame

4. **Write your launch message**:
   ```

   ‚ú® Features:

   ```

5. **Click "Cast"**

6. **Your frame should appear** with interactive buttons!

### Method 2: Using Farcaster API (Advanced)

```bash
# Install Farcaster SDK
npm install @farcaster/auth-client

# Create cast with frame
farcaster cast create --url "https://bug-bounty-mini-app-swib.vercel.app" --text "Check out my Bug Bounty Platform!"
```

## Step 5: Enable MiniKit Integration (Optional)

If you want deeper Farcaster integration with MiniKit:

### Update `minikit.config.ts`
Your config is already set up:
```typescript
export const miniKitConfig = {
  appName: 'Bug Bounty Platform',
  contractAddress: '0x5Eb412b6FcB13225C3d5C2aE39570D86a894C11a',
  network: 'base-sepolia',
}
```

### Register MiniKit App
1. Go to: https://developers.farcaster.xyz
2. Create new app
3. Add your Vercel URL
4. Get App ID
5. Update your `.env`:
   ```
   NEXT_PUBLIC_FARCASTER_APP_ID=your_app_id_here
   ```

---

## Step 6: Monitor Your Frame

### Analytics to Track:

1. **Vercel Analytics**
   - Go to: https://vercel.com/dashboard
   - Select your project
   - View analytics

2. **Frame Interactions**
   - Monitor button clicks
   - Track wallet connections
   - Bounty creation stats

3. **Contract Activity**
   - Base Sepolia explorer: https://sepolia.basescan.org/address/0x5Eb412b6FcB13225C3d5C2aE39570D86a894C11a
   - Watch for transactions

## Troubleshooting Common Issues

### Issue 1: Frame Not Showing
**Problem**: URL doesn't render as frame in Warpcast

**Solutions**:
- Check Open Graph meta tags in `app/layout.tsx`
- Verify URL is publicly accessible
- Use Frame Validator to test

### Issue 2: Buttons Not Working
**Problem**: Frame buttons don't respond

**Solutions**:
- Check browser console for errors
- Verify wallet connector is working
- Test on desktop and mobile

### Issue 3: Wallet Connection Fails
**Problem**: Users can't connect wallets

**Solutions**:
- Verify wagmi config is correct
- Check Base Sepolia RPC is working
- Test with different wallets (MetaMask, Coinbase Wallet)

## Frame Best Practices

### 1. Optimize Images
- Use optimized images for splash screen
- Keep images under 1MB
- Use WebP format when possible

### 2. Fast Loading
- Your frame should load in < 3 seconds
- Minimize heavy computations on initial load
- Use Vercel Edge Functions for API routes

### 3. Mobile Friendly
- Test on mobile Warpcast app
- Ensure buttons are touch-friendly
- Responsive design (you already have this!)

### 4. Clear CTAs
Your frame should have clear actions:
- ‚úÖ "View Bounties" button
- ‚úÖ "Create Bounty" button
- ‚úÖ "Connect Wallet" button
