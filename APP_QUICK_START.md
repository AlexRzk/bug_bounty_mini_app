# App Quick Start Guide ðŸš€

## Prerequisites

Before running the app, you need:

1. âœ… **Node.js 18+** installed
2. âœ… **Smart contract deployed** on Base (see `CONTRACT_DEPLOYMENT.md`)
3. âœ… **Contract address** copied from deployment

## Step 1: Configure Environment

Create `.env.local` in the root directory:

```env
# Smart contract deployed on Base mainnet
NEXT_PUBLIC_BOUNTY_MANAGER_ADDRESS=0x1234567890123456789012345678901234567890

# Base mainnet RPC URL (used by app)
NEXT_PUBLIC_BASE_RPC_URL=https://mainnet.base.org

# App URL (for Farcaster mini app)
NEXT_PUBLIC_URL=http://localhost:3000

# Optional: Neynar API (for Farcaster bot - currently disabled)
# NEYNAR_API_KEY=your_api_key
# BOT_PRIVATE_KEY=0x_your_key
```

**Get contract address from deployment:**
```bash
cd contracts
forge script script/DeployBountyManagerV2.s.sol --rpc-url base --broadcast 2>&1 | grep "deployed to:"
```

## Step 2: Install Dependencies

```bash
# Install npm packages
pnpm install
# or
npm install
# or
yarn install
```

## Step 3: Run Development Server

```bash
pnpm dev
# or
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```

Opens at: **http://localhost:3000**

You should see:
- ðŸŽ¨ The bounty board with UI
- ðŸ’° Bounty cards (initially empty)
- âž• "Create Bounty" button
- ðŸ‘¤ Wallet connect button

## Step 4: Connect Wallet

1. Click **"Connect Wallet"** button (top right)
2. Choose wallet (MetaMask recommended)
3. Approve connection to app
4. Wallet shows connected

**Wallet must:**
- Have some ETH on Base mainnet
- Be on Base network (auto-switches)

## Step 5: Test Create Bounty

1. Click **"Create Bounty"** button
2. Fill in form:
   - **Title:** "Fix login bug"
   - **Description:** "Users can't log in after update"
   - **Reward:** "0.01" ETH
   - **Severity:** "High"
3. Click **"Create"**
4. Approve transaction in MetaMask
5. Wait for confirmation (~1-2 seconds)
6. Bounty appears on board! âœ¨

## Step 6: View Bounty

Click on bounty card to see:
- Full description
- Reward amount
- Severity level
- Bounty details
- Submit response button

## Step 7: Submit Response

1. Click on a bounty
2. Click **"Submit Response"**
3. Write your solution/report
4. Click **"Submit"**
5. Approve transaction
6. Response appears in bounty details

## Step 8: Complete Bounty

As bounty creator:
1. View your bounty
2. See responses from hunters
3. Click response to accept
4. Confirm acceptance
5. Winner receives ETH reward
6. Bounty marked complete âœ…

## Troubleshooting

### "Contract not found" error
- Check contract address is correct
- Contract must be deployed on Base
- Try contract address on BaseScan

### "Wrong network" error
- Switch MetaMask to Base mainnet
- Go to https://chainlist.org
- Search "Base" 
- Add to MetaMask

### "Insufficient balance" error
- Need ETH on Base for gas
- Bridge ETH from mainnet: https://bridge.base.org
- Need ~0.01 ETH per transaction

### App shows blank
- Clear cache: Ctrl+Shift+Delete
- Hard refresh: Ctrl+Shift+R (or Cmd+Shift+R on Mac)
- Check console for errors: F12

### Wallet won't connect
- Refresh page
- Try different wallet
- Check MetaMask network is Base

## Available Commands

```bash
# Development
pnpm dev              # Start dev server

# Production
pnpm build            # Build for production
pnpm start            # Run production build

# Code quality
pnpm lint             # Run ESLint
```

## Smart Contract Interaction

### Creating Bounty (On-chain)
```
1. User sends ETH + data to contract
2. Contract creates Bounty struct
3. ETH held in contract escrow
4. BountyCreated event emitted
```

### Submitting Response (On-chain)
```
1. Hunter submits response data
2. Contract stores Response struct
3. Links response to bounty
4. ResponseSubmitted event emitted
```

### Completing Bounty (On-chain)
```
1. Creator accepts response
2. Contract transfers ETH to winner
3. Bounty marked complete
4. BountyCompleted event emitted
```
